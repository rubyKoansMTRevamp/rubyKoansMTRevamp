# Ruby Koans Revamp ðŸš€

*New koans for Ruby*

1. To run the Koans, open a file and write an answer in the underlined section (fill in the gaps!), save your file and run `bundle exec guard` in your terminal. (Don't forget to run this command otherwise the koans will *not* work!)
2. Every time you write an answer and save, you will receive a hint in your terminal and whether you haved passed that koan or if you should meditate some more.
3. You can use Control + D to exit guard.
4. Once you are finished with all the exercises in one file, move on to the next. Happy koaning!
